    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the world including the United States for many years. With the increasing rate of cases for heart diseases worldwide, it is important to focus at the leading causes of this disease and establish a relationship between these vicious disease. As a base for our analysis we are going to use the heart disease dataset available at Kaggle. \n",
    "(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset/data)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the cleaned version of the data set given in Canvas -> group_project_proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset originates from 1988 and evaluates data from four different databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach V. While the dataset does have 76 distinct attributes, it only utilizes 14 of them. In our group project, we chose to focus on the variables age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and  maximum heart rate and compere it to the diagnosis of heart disease. We chose this variables since according to National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) it is considered one of the leading reason of causing the heart disease. We will be comparing the numerical variables by the categorical variables (2 cases) “0” and “1” which shows the diagnosis of heart diseases. \n",
    "\n",
    "From these following informations, we will be attempting to answer the following predictive question. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Predictive question:**\n",
    "How does the amount of cholesterol, type of heart defect, age, and sex help us predict the diagnosis of heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be conducting a KNN classification in order to answer the predictive question."

Essentially, we are going to use predictor variables amount of cholesterol, maximum heart rate, age and resting blood pressure to predict the diagnosis class of heart disease, which can be categorized into 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease). Therefore, the column names we will incorporate are `chol`, `thalach`, `age`, `trestbps` and `target`. We chose to only use four predictor variables because we think that there are more than two factors that contribute to the diagnosis of heart disease.

Instead of using the `fit()` function, we use the `tune_grid()` function to fit the model for each value in the range of parameter values.

    "From exploring this heart disease data, we found that not all the predictor variables we used had a strong correlation with the diagnosis of heart disease. For example, it seemed that there was a weak correlation between age and cholesterol. This suggests that the higher the age, the less likely that people will be diagnosed with heart disease which is surprisingly the exact opposite to the norm. Similarly, there appeared almost no correlation between age and resting blood pressure. Generally speaking, younger people tend to have lower maximum heart rates. Nevertheless, our data showed that the lower the age, the higher the maximum heart rate there will be, implying that younger patients will have a higher chance of getting a heart disease. Aside from our graphs, we standardized (setting the mean as 0 and standard deviation as 1) our dataset to ensure reliability and accuracy of our data. Moreover, we calculated our accuracy to be approximately 87.5% and precision to be around 90%. In our perspective, we strongly think that these percentages are very high relative to our heart disease setting (as discussed earlier). Conversely, our recall was fairly low with about 85%. If a patient is diagnosed with a heart disease, there is a 15% chance that we will miss it which is a very high rate in the medical realm.\n",

    "The visualization between the age of the patient vs the cholesterol, maximum heart rate, and resting blood pressure showed us a result that was somewhat different from what we expected initially. \n",
    "For the age vs cholesterol scatter plot, we hypothesized that the higher the age, the higher the cholesterol amount would be, which could increase the number of heart diseases. However, according to the plot provided, it seems like there is a weak to no correlation between those two variables. Moreover, there was an interesting observation made in this plot. While the diagnosis of “Yes” was spread out to the whole plot, the diagnosis of “No” was particularly higher compared to the lower ages. This conflicted with our hypothesis, that the higher the age, the higher the heart disease number would be. \n",
    "For the age vs max heart rate scatter plot, There was a moderate negative correlation between those two variables, which supported our hypothesis, which was that the patient with younger age would have a higher maximum heart rate. In this visualization, it shows that people with higher max heart rates have a higher number of heart diseases. \n",
    "For the age vs resting blood pressure, it did not give us useful information to analyze since it had no correlation between them. \n",
    "For our KNN classification, we initially hypothesized that using age, cholesterol, max heart rate, and resting blood pressure as predictors, the KNN model would accurately predict heart disease. This hypothesis was correct to some degree where the accuracy of the model was around 87.5%. The confusion matrix showed correct predictions for “No” heart disease, but some misclassifications for “Yes” heart disease. Precision was around 90%, indicating a relatively high proportion of true positives among positive predictions. However, the recall was around 85%, suggesting that the model missed identifying some actual cases of heart disease. Also, in the medical world, miss predicting the result of malicious diseases such as heart disease will lead to serious problems such as deaths. Although there could be some interpretation for what is considered “high” accuracy, precision, recall, in this case of predicting a heart disease, it should have a higher value in order to validate the prediction. \n",

    "While our analysis into resting blood pressure could not give us any useful findings, cholesterol and maximum heart rate certainly did.\n",
    "Many of the interpretations taken from the age and cholesterol plot refute concrete scientific claims from both the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Aging of the United States. Conceived notions like heart disease risk and total cholesterol increasing with age are not present in the plots. While the concentration of the spread in the ages of 48-61 and other variables in the sample should still be taken into account , this might warrant more extensive data analysis with other samples and other machine learning algorithms. In the case of these also rebutting prior claims, it is of probable caution to further investigate in research in human anatomy.\n",
    "It was also found that there is a positive correlation between maximum heart rate and risk of heart disease. With this in mind, it is possible for an increase in prevention, with more people paying attention to their heart rate and taking the necessary precautions to lower it when at high rates.\n",
    "The heart disease model proposed is a glimpse of what can be done with machine learning and data analysis. This specific model unfortunately, cannot, under any circumstances be used as a diagnostic tool due to its 15% misdiagnosis rate. In other fields, a 85% success rate might be acceptable, but with a health-risk so high in the form of false-positives and false-negatives (unnecessary or potentially life-risking medication, etc.) it is prudent that it not be used. It does however, project a bright future in data-based/AI diagnosis. If the model can be improved, with different algorithms, variables and samples, the misdiagnosis rate can fall a considerable rate, to the point of it being medically viable. This would be extremely valuable for the medical field, and would also help in the future computer diagnosis of hard to detect medical conditions.\n",

    "Based on our research the accuracy and precision were about 85% - 90%, however, the variables that we chose could’ve affected those numbers. Therefore, conducting a KNN classification using a different variable could increase or decrease the accuracy/precision. This raises another question that we could conduct in the future: What variables have the highest accuracy/precision in order to predict the diagnosis of heart disease? Other possible questions include: How does gender influence the likelihood of being diagnosed with heart disease? How do other variables such as fasting blood pressure, depression, and exercise affect the diagnosis of heart disease?\n"
