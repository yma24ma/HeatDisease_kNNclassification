    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heart diseases are one of the leading causes of death in the world including the United States for many years. With the increasing rate of cases for heart diseases worldwide, it is important to focus at the leading causes of this disease and establish a relationship between these vicious disease. As a base for our analysis we are going to use the heart disease dataset available at Kaggle. \n",

    "This is the cleaned version of the data set given in Canvas -> group_project_proposal\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset originates from 1988 and evaluates data from four different databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland and Long Beach V. While the dataset does have 76 distinct attributes, it only utilizes 14 of them. In our group project, we chose to focus on the variables age, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and  maximum heart rate and compere it to the diagnosis of heart disease. We chose this variables since according to National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) it is considered one of the leading reason of causing the heart disease. We will be comparing the numerical variables by the categorical variables (2 cases) “0” and “1” which shows the diagnosis of heart diseases. \n",

    "From thee following informations, we will be attempting to answer the following predictive question. \n",

    "How does the amount of cholesterol, type of heart defect, age, and sex help us predict the diagnosis of heart disease?\n",

Essentially, we are going to use predictor variables chol (amount of cholesterol), thal (type of heart defect), age and sex to predict the diagnosis class of heart disease, which can be categorized into 0 (no heart disease) or 1 (heart disease). Therefore, the column names we will incorporate are chol, thal, age, sex and target. We chose to only use four predictor variables because we think that there are more than two factors that contribute to the diagnosis of heart disease.
