# kNN Classification using Heart Disease Dataset
We conducted a k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) classification to predict the likelihood of heart disease diagnosis based on a subset of key health indicators. Specifically, we focused on cholesterol levels, chest pain type, age, and sex as predictors. The goal was to determine whether these features could reliably classify patients as having heart disease or not.
